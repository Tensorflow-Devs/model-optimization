  """Activation wrapper for quantization aware training.

  The goal of this class is to apply quantize operations during training such
  that the training network mimics quantization loss experienced in activations
  during inference.

  It introduces quantization loss before and after activations as required to
  mimic inference loss. The layer has built-in knowledge of how quantized
  activations are laid out during inference to emulate exact behavior.

  For example, ReLU activations are typically fused into their parent layer
  such as Conv/Dense. Hence, loss is introduced only after the activation has
  been applied. For Softmax on the other hand quantization loss is experienced
  both before and after the activation.

  Input shape:
    Arbitrary.

  Output shape:
    Same shape as input.
